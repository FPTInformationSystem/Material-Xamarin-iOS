## Welcome to Material

Material is an animation and graphics framework that is used to create beautiful applications.

Material-Xamarin-iOS is a ported version from Material-Swift. For more information about the original, please visit: https://www.github.com/CosmicMind

## About Material 2

The official site says that
>"The first version of Material was to bring Material Design to iOS. We considered that a great starting point, but not the entire story. Material 2 is the next chapter, which goes deeper into iOS with refined APIs that simplify Architecture, Photo Library, Reminders, Text Editing, Photo & Video, and much more. In addition to Material Design, we love Appleâ€™s flat UI. Having this in mind, we made it possible to accomplish both UI styles with ease."

We are trying to catch up them as soon as possible. They have to deal with Swift 2, 2.3, 3.0 while C# is the only thing we care about.
